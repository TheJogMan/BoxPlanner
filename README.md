# BoxPlanner
Tool for experimenting with different arrangements of various supplies.

Much of the code included in this project is rather old and I am in the process of rewritting a lot of it, it is only used in this project because the newer version is still very much a work in progress and this old code still works which is exactly what I needed for this project.
The jogLibrary.universal package contains the bulk of my more recent work.
